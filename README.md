Sarah Morley's Frogger
===============================

This is Sarah Morley's implementation of the basic Frogger game, based on the starter code provided by Udacity: https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

## How to Play

The game starts automatically by opening "index.html". From there you can see the main player in the center of the bottom row of grass, as well as multiple enemy "bugs" moving randomly across the stones. The point of the game is to move your player (using arrow directional keys "up", "down", "left", and "right") and make it to the water without colliding with one of the enemy bugs. If you reach the water then it resets your player to the starting position, and incrememnts your "wins" at the top. If you collide with an enemy bug, then you are reset to the starting position, and your "collisions" are incrememted at the top. The goal is to see how many wins you can get, while avoiding collisions.
